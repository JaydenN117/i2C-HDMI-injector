Injects i2c signal to Dasung Paperlike Pro monitor through HDMI on modern macs, work in progress, have not ordered. 
Reversed engineered signal by simply reading with Oscilloscope.
Did not order kicad and would redo differently to make assembly easier but it was more of a learning excersize.

I ended up desoldering the pins to minimize footprint so perhaps a version [Without Presoldered headers](https://www.amazon.com/Cermant-Connector-Board%EF%BC%8C2-54-Connectors-Electronics/dp/B0DGT2GBF2/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1XA49GEN952SV&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wnXFwrPHh2Wy17ayIPccoBIL8KxakjZDtvmHJkkTAlMDZeKj3Czd9LiIU-Kwsi7Nqi-2jN4aoVW34E_hqIrcMvuNJx7e_I-N3xs7jnSWvXC4oEtcZZHjoqG-L8XqdfTxVmkknt1iNr-1adhB3cEDv7u-sZVyfK5oB3dWg2uLBRj0hetf7i4Ps4rZKrzQFFSpVxv2FbYm0bVkLDBmiJiZs0Vt59FCVLn54sFATGShZ1A.F93ZgeioDOl6SbsPNRtD_hkZNoThlQJ6RECbz6dxoDw&dib_tag=se&keywords=HDMI+A+Connector+with+Test+PCB+Board&qid=1759920313&sprefix=hdmi+a+connector+with+test+pcb+board%2Caps%2C161&sr=8-3) would have been a better purchase
